    How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
    Running tests is one of the easiest ways to check if software is functional and secure.
    I used unit testing as the main feature in this project.
    
    How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
    Interpreting user needs is based on productive communication with the user/client as well as testing
    design documents to make sure that they include any changes needed.
    
    How do I approach designing software?
    Any approach to software design needs to start with learning the requirements for the software,
    then making sure all documents follow these needs and finishs with testing the finished product against these documents.
